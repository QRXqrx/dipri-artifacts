## Artifacts of TOSEM'23 submission: *DiPri: Distance-based Seed Prioritization for Greybox Fuzzing*

This is the guideline repository for the TOSEM submission *DiPri: Distance-based Seed Prioritization for Greybox Fuzzing*.

### 1 Cross-language implementation of DiPri

We have implemented DiPri in both C/C++ and Java respectively on top of AFL++ (version 4.06) and Zest 
(version 2.0-SNAPSHOT). We put the source code of these two implementations in two separate repositories.
The links to the two implementations are as follows:

- AFL++-dipri (C/C++ implementation): https://github.com/QRXqrx/aflpp-dipri
- Zest-dipri (Java implementation): https://github.com/YangDingNY/zest-dipri
